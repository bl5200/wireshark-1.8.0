    // The GTK+ Open Capture File dialog has the following elements and features:
    //   - The ability to select a capture file from a list of known extensions
    //   - A display filter entry
    //   - Name resolution checkboxes
    //   - Capture file preview information
    // Ideally we should provide similar functionality here.
    //
    // You can subclass QFileDialog (which we've done here) and add widgets as
    // described at
    // http://developer.qt.nokia.com/faq/answer/how_can_i_add_widgets_to_my_qfiledialog_instance
    // However, Qt's idea of what a file dialog looks like isn't what Microsoft
    // and Apple think a file dialog looks like.
    //
    // On Windows Vista and later we should probably use IFileOpenDialog. On earlier
    // versions of Windows (including XP) we should use GetOpenFileName, which is
    // what we do in ui/win32/file_dlg_win32.c. On OS X we should use NSOpenPanel. On
    // other platforms we should fall back to QFileDialog.
    //
    // Yes, that's four implementations of the same window.
    //
    // If a plain native open file dialog is good enough we can just the static
    // version of QFileDialog::getOpenFileName. (Commenting out Q_OBJECT and
    // "explicit" below has the same effect.)
