Wireshark 1.8.0 Release Notes

   ------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer.
   It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and
   education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

     o When saving the displayed packets, packets which are
       dependencies (e.g., due to reassembly) of the displayed
       packets are included in the list of saved packets ([1]Bug
       3315).

     o Rearranging columns in preferences doesn't work on 64-bit
       Windows. ([2]Bug 6077)

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.6:

     o Wireshark supports capturing from multiple interfaces at once.

     o You can now add, edit, and save packet and capture file
       annotations.

     o Wireshark, TShark, and their associated utilities now save
       files using the pcap-ng file format by default. (Your copy of
       Wireshark might still use the pcap file format if pcap-ng is
       disabled in your preferences.)

     o Decryption key management for IEEE 802.11, IPsec, and ISAKMP
       is easier.

     o OID resolution is now supported on 64-bit Windows.

     o The "Save As" menu item has been split into "Save As", which
       lets you save a file using a different filename and "Export
       Specified Packets", which lets you have more control over
       which packets are saved.

     o TCP fast retransmissions are now indicated as an expert info
       note, rather than a warning, just as TCP retransmissions are.

     o TCP window updates are no longer colorized as "Bad TCP".

     o TShark's command-line options have changed. The previously
       undocumented -P option is now -2 option for performing a
       two-pass analysis; the former -S option is now the -P option
       for printing packets even if writing to a file, and the -S
       option is now used to specify a different line separator
       between packets.

     o GeoIP IPv6 databases are now supported.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [3]http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the [4]download page on the Wireshark web
   site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default locations on your system.
